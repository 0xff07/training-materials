\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Suspend to RAM}
Used mostly on phones (Android, Firefox OS, ...) and PC.\\
May not be acceptable for devices that are idle most of the time or
for a long time (e.g. digital cameras, motion detecting video surveillance).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hibernate}
Also called suspend to disk.\\
Used in SONY digital cameras (booting in about 1s). Used in credit
card payment terminals (our customer).\\
Requires sufficient amount of RAM and storage (NAND, eMMC, ...).\\
Storage has to be quite fast.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Checkpointing}
Similar to hibernate, but the state of the system is selectively saved
to disk. It will require less storage and will probably boot faster.\\
For Android, have a look at:
