\section{Download infrastructure in Buildroot}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item One important aspect of Buildroot is to fetch source code or
    binary files from third party projects.
  \item Download supported from HTTP(S), FTP, Git, Subversion, CVS,
    Mercurial, etc.
  \item Being able to do reproducible builds over a long period of
    time requires understanding the download infrastructure.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Download location}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Each Buildroot package indicates in its \code{.mk} file which
    files it needs to be downloaded.
  \item Can be a tarball, one or several patches, binary files, etc.
  \item When downloading a file, Buildroot will successively try the
    following locations:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The local \code{$(DL_DIR)} directory where downloaded files
      are kept
    \item The {\bf primary site}, as indicated by \code{BR2_PRIMARY_SITE}
    \item The {\bf original site}, as indicated by the package
      \code{.mk} file
    \item The {\bf backup Buildroot mirror}, as indicated by
      \code{BR2_BACKUP_SITE}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Primary site}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \code{BR2_PRIMARY_SITE} option allows to define the
    location of a HTTP or FTP server.
  \item By default empty, so this feature is disabled.
  \item When defined, used in priority over the original location.
  \item Allows to do a local mirror, in your company, of all the files
    that Buildroot needs to download.
  \item When option \code{BR2_PRIMARY_SITE_ONLY} is enabled, only the
    {\em primary site} is used
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It does not fall back on the original site and the backup
      Buildroot mirror
    \item Guarantees that all downloads must be in the primary site
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Backup Buildroot mirror}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Since sometimes the upstream location disappear or are
    temporarily unavailable, having a backup server is sometimes
    useful
  \item Address configured through \code{BR2_BACKUP_SITE}
  \item Defaults to \code{http://sources.buildroot.net}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item maintained by the Buildroot community
    \item updated before every Buildroot release to contain the
      downloaded files for all packages
    \item exception: cannot store all possible versions for packages
      that have their version as a configuration option. Generally
      only affects the kernel or bootloader, which typically don't
      disappear upstream.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{{\tt DL\_DIR}}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Once a file has been downloaded by Buildroot, it is cached in
    the directory pointed by \code{$(DL_DIR)}
  \item By default, \code{$(TOPDIR)/dl}
  \item Can be changed
    \begin{itemize}
    \item using the \code{BR2_DL_DIR} configuration option
    \item or by passing the \code{BR2_DL_DIR} environment variable
    \end{itemize}
  \item The download mechanism is written in a way that allows
    independent parallel builds to share the same \code{DL_DIR} (using
    atomic renaming of files)
  \item No cleanup mechanism: files are only added, never removed,
    even when the package version is updated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Special case of VCS download}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When a package uses the source code from Git, Subversion or
    another VCS, Buildroot cannot directly download a tarball.
  \item It uses a VCS-specific method to fetch the specified version
    of the source from the VCS repository
  \item The source code is stored in a temporary location
  \item Finally a tarball containing only the source code (and not the
    version control history or metadata) is created and stored in
    \code{DL_DIR}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Example: \code{avrdude-eabe067c4527bc2eedc5db9288ef5cf1818ec720.tar.gz}
    \end{itemize}
  \item This tarball will be re-used for the next builds.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Download-related {\tt make} targets}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \code{make source}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Triggers the download of all the files needed to build the
      current configuration.
    \item All files are stored in \code{$(DL_DIR)}
    \item Allows to prepare a fully offline build
    \end{itemize}
  \item \code{make external-deps}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Lists the files from \code{$(DL_DIR)} that are needed for
      the current configuration to build.
    \item Does not guarantee that all files are in \code{$(DL_DIR)}, a
      \code{make source} is required
    \end{itemize}
  \item \code{make source-check}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Checks where the upstream site of all downloads needed for
      the current configuration are still available.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
