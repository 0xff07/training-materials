\frametitle{Filesystem impact on performance}
Tuning the filesystem is usually one of the first things
we work on in boot time projects.
\begin{itemize}
\item Different filesystems can have different initialization
      and mount times. In particular, the type of filesystem
      for the root filesystem directly impacts boot time.
\item Different filesystems can exhibit different read, write
      and access time performance, according to the type 
      of filesystem activity and to the type of files in the
      system. 
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Different filesystem for different storage types}
\begin{itemize}
\item Raw flash storage
      \begin{itemize}
      \item JFFS2
      \item YAFFS2
      \item UBIFS
      \end{itemize}
\item Block storage (including memory cards, eMMC)
      \begin{itemize}
      \item ext2, ext3, ext4
      \item xfs, jfs, reiserfs 
      \item btrfs
      \item f2fs
      \item SquashFS
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{JFFS2}
For raw flash storage
\begin{itemize}
\item Mount time depending on filesystem size: the kernel has to
      scan the whole filesystem at mount time, to read which block
      belongs to each file.
\item Need to use the \code{CONFIG_JFFS2_SUMMARY} kernel option
      to store such information in flash. This dramatically reduces
      mount time (from 16 s to 0.8 s for a 128 MB partition).
\item Rather poor read and write performance (compared to YAFFS2 and
      UBIFS)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{YAFFS2}
For raw flash storage
\begin{itemize}
\item Mount time depending on filesystem size: the kernel has to
\item Good mount time
\item Good read and write performance
\item Drawbacks: no compression, not in the mainline Linux kernel
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{UBIFS}
For raw flash storage
\begin{itemize}
\item Not so good mount time, because of the time needed
      to initialize UBI (\code{ubi_attach} command in userspace).
      Filesystem getting slower and slower as it gets older.
\item Need \code{CONFIG_UBI_FASTMAP} (introduced in Linux 3.7) to do
      \code{ubi_attach} in constant time, and get a good mount time. 
\item Good read and write performance (similar to YAFFS2)
\item Other advantages: better for wear leveling (operates on the whole
      flash storage, not only within a flash partition).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Block filesystems}
For block storage
\begin{itemize}
\item ext4: best for rather big partitions, good read and write
      performance
\item xfs, jfs, reiserfs: can be good in some read or write scenarii
      as well.
\item btrfs, f2fs: can achieve best read and write performance,
      taking advantage of the characteristics of flash-based block
      devices.
\item SquashFS: best mount time and read performance, for read-only
      partitions. Great for root filesystems which can be read-only.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Finding the best filesystem}
\begin{itemize}
\item Raw flash storage: UBIFS with \code{CONFIG_UBI_FASTMAP} is
      probably the best solution.
\item Block storage: SquashFS best solution for root filesystems
      which can be read-only. Btrfs and f2fs probably the best solutions
      for read/write filesystems.
\item Fortunately, changing filesystem types is quite cheap,
      and completely transparent for applications. Just try 
      several filesystem options, as see which one works best 
      for you!
\item Do not focus only on boot time. \\
      For systems in which read and write performance matters, we 
      recommend to use separate root filesystem (for quick
      boot time) and data partitions (for good runtime performance). 
\end{itemize}
