\item Linux Plumbers: \url{https://linuxplumbersconf.org}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item About the low-level plumbing of Linux: kernel,
    audio, power management, device management, multimedia, etc.
    Not really a conventional conference with formal presentations,
    but rather a place where contributors on each topic meet, share their progress and make
    plans for work ahead.
  \end{itemize}
