{\bf Caution}: you may face a known issue installing the
\code{libqt4-dev} package on Ubuntu 14.04, complaining about
incompatible dependencies.

If this happens to you, here is a workaround:

\code{sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 \
libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0}

After doing this, you will be able to install \code{libqt4-dev}.

This bug is documented on
\url{http://askubuntu.com/questions/593644/installing-qt4-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts}.
