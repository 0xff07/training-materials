{\bf Caution: known issue in Ubuntu 12.04 and later (still present
in Ubuntu 14.04)}: if download through tftp doesn't work,
you may have to stop the \code{tftpd-hpa} server and start it
again every time you boot your workstation:

\code{
sudo service tftpd-hpa restart
}

The problem is Ubuntu starts this server too early, before the
preconditions it needs are met. When you restart the service
long after the machine has booted, this issue is no longer
present.

If it still doesn't work, another (radical!) workaround is to
reinstall the \code{tftpd-hpa} server!

\code{
sudo apt-get install --reinstall tftpd-hpa
}

So far, we haven't had the time yet to investigate the root
cause of the issue that is addressed by this last workaround.
