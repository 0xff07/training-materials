\subchapter{Using the I2C bus}{Objective: make the I2C bus work and
use it to implement communication with the Nunchuk device}

After this lab, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Declare pinctrl settings
\item Access I2C device registers through the bus
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

Stay in the \code{~/felabs/linux/src/linux} directory for kernel and DTB
compiling (stay in the \code{nunchuk} branch), and in
\code{~/felabs/linux/modules/nfsroot/nunchuk} for module compiling
(use two different terminals).

\section{Add pinctrl properties to the Device Tree}

As you found in the previous lab, we now managed to have our nunchuk
device enumerated on the \code{i2c1} bus.

However, to access the bus data and clock signals, we need to configure
the pin muxing of the SoC.

If you go back to the BeagleBone Black System Reference Manual, in the
{\em Connector P9} section, you can see that the pins \code{17} and
\code{18} that we are using correspond to pins \code{A16} and \code{B16}
of the AM335 SoC. You can also see that such pins need to be configured 
as \code{MODE2} to get the functionality that we need (\code{I2C1_SCL}
and \code{I2C1_SDA}).

Now look at the Device Tree for the AM335x EVM board
(\code{arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-evm.dts}). It's using \code{i2c1} too.

Edit the \code{arch/arm/boot/dts/am335x-bone-common.dtsi} file and 
add what's needed to enable pin muxing for \code{i2c1}.
Don't hesitate to go back to the lectures to understand what to do!

Rebuild and update your DTB, and eventually reboot the board.

We will use the \code{i2cdetect} command to make sure that 
everything works fine for \code{i2c1}:

\begin{verbatim}
# i2cdetect -l
i2c-0	i2c       	OMAP I2C adapter                	I2C adapter
i2c-1	i2c       	OMAP I2C adapter                	I2C adapter
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
# i2cdetect -F 1
Functionalities implemented by /dev/i2c-1:
I2C                              yes
SMBus Quick Command              no
SMBus Send Byte                  yes
SMBus Receive Byte               yes
SMBus Write Byte                 yes
SMBus Read Byte                  yes
SMBus Write Word                 yes
SMBus Read Word                  yes
SMBus Process Call               yes
SMBus Block Write                yes
SMBus Block Read                 no
SMBus Block Process Call         no
SMBus PEC                        yes
I2C Block Write                  yes
I2C Block Read                   yes
\end{verbatim}

You can see that the {\em SMBus Quick Commands} are not available on
this driver, yet \code{i2cdetect} uses them by default to scan the i2c
bus. You can use \code{i2cdetect -r} to use the usual set of i2c
commands, and by able to detect the devices on your bus.

To test if everything works fine, run \code{i2cdetect -r 1}. This will
scan the \code{i2c1} bus for devices. You should see a device at the
address \code{0x52}. This is your nunchuk.

If everything works as expected, commit your Device Tree changes. This
will be required switch to another branch later:

\begin{verbatim}
git commit -as
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{git commit -a} adds all the files already known to
      \code{git} to the commit.
\item \code{git commit -s} adds a \code{Signed-off-by} line (required
      for all contributions to the Linux kernel).
\end{itemize}

\section{Device initialization}

The next step is to read the state of the nunchuk registers, to find out
whether buttons are pressed or not, for example.

Before being able to read nunchuk registers, the first thing to do is 
to send initialization commands to it. That's also a nice way of making
sure i2c communication works as expected.

In the probe routine (run every time a matching device is found):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the I2C raw API (see the slides), send two bytes to the
      device: \code{0xf0} and \code{0x55}. Make sure you check the return value of 
      the function you're using. This could reveal communication issues.
      Using LXR, find examples of how to handle failures properly using
      the same function.
\item Let the CPU wait for 1 ms by using the \code{udelay()} routine.
      You may need to use LXR again to find the right C headers to
      include.
\item In the same way, send the \code{0xfb} and \code{0x00} bytes now. 
      This completes the nunchuk initialization.
\end{enumerate}

Recompile and load the driver, and make sure you have no communication
errors.

\section{Read nunchuk registers}

The nunchuk exhibits a rather weird behaviour: it seems that it update
the state of its internal registers only when they have been read.

As a consequence, we will need to read the registers twice!

To keep the code simple and readable, let's create a
\code{nunchuk_read_registers} function to do this. In this function:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start by putting a \code{10 ms} delay by calling the
      \code{mdelay()} routine. That's needed to add time between the
      previous i2c operation and the next one.
\item Write \code{0x00} to the bus. That will allow us to read
      the device registers.
\item Add another \code{10 ms} delay.
\item Read 6 bytes from the device, still using the I2C raw API.
      Check the return value as usual. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reading the state of the nunchuk buttons}

Back to the \code{probe()} function, call your new function twice.

After the second call, compute the states of the \code{Z} and \code{C}
buttons, which can be found in the sixth byte that you read.

As explained on
\url{http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sullivae/ece375/pdf/nunchuk.pdf}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{bit 0 == 0} means that \code{Z} is pressed. 
\item \code{bit 0 == 1} means that \code{Z} is released. 
\item \code{bit 1 == 0} means that \code{C} is pressed. 
\item \code{bit 1 == 1} means that \code{C} is released. 
\end{itemize}

Using boolean operators, write code that initializes a \code{zpressed}
integer variable, which value is \code{1} when the \code{Z} button is
pressed, and \code{0} otherwise. Create a similar \code{cpressed}
variable for the \code{C} button.\footnote{You may use the \code{BIT()}
macro, which will make your life easier. See LXR for details.}

The last thing is to test the states of these new variables at the end
of the \code{probe()} function, and log a message to the console
when one of the buttons is pressed.

\section{Testing}

Compile your module, and reload it. No button presses should be
detected. Remove your module.

Now hold the \code{Z} and reload and remove your module again:
\begin{verbatim}
insmod /root/nunchuk/nunchuk.ko; rmmod nunchuk
\end{verbatim}

You should now see the message confirming that the driver found
out that the \code{Z} button was held.

Do the same over and over again with various button states.

At this stage, we just made sure that we could read the state
of the device registers through the I2C bus. Of course, loading and
removing the module every time is not an acceptable way of 
accessing such data. We will give the driver a proper {\em input}
interface in the next slides.
