\subchapter{Input interface}{Objective: make the I2C device available
to userspace using the input subsystem.}

After this lab, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Expose device events to userspace through an input interface
      (kernel space perspective)
\item Get more familiar with the usage of the input interface
      (user space perspective)
\end{itemize}

\section{Add polled input device support to the kernel}

Rebuild your kernel with static support for polled input device support
(\code{CONFIG_INPUT_POLLDEV=y}). With the default configuration, this
feature is available as a module, which is less convenient.

Update and reboot your kernel.
