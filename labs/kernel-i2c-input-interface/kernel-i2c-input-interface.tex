\subchapter{Input interface}{Objective: make the I2C device available
to userspace using the input subsystem.}

After this lab, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Expose device events to userspace through an input interface
      (kernel space perspective)
\item Get more familiar with the usage of the input interface
      (user space perspective)
\end{itemize}
