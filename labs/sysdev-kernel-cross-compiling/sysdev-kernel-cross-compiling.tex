\subchapter{Kernel - Cross-compiling}{Objective: Learn how to cross-compile a kernel for an OMAP target platform.}

After this lab, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up a cross-compiling environment
\item Configure the kernel Makefile accordingly
\item Cross compile the kernel for the IGEPv2 arm board
\item Use U-Boot to download the kernel
\item Check that the kernel you compiled starts the system
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

Go to the \code{/home/<user>/felabs/sysdev/kernel} directory.

Install the following packages: \code{libqt4-dev} and
\code{u-boot-tools}. \code{libqt4-dev} is needed for the
\code{xconfig} kernel configuration interface, and \code{u-boot-tools}
is needed to build the \code{uImage} kernel image file for U-Boot.

\section{Target system}

We are going to cross-compile and boot a Linux kernel for the IGEPv2
board.

\section{Kernel sources}

We will re-use the kernel sources downloaded and patched in the
previous lab. However, we will have to apply two additional patches
that add NAND support for the IGEPv2 revision 6 board that we are
using in this course:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
cat ../linux-3.2-arm-omap2-make-board-onenand-init-visible-to-board-code.patch | patch -p1
cat ../linux-3.2-arm-omap3-igep0020-add-support-for-micron-nand-flash.patch | patch -p1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{Cross-compiling environment setup}

To cross-compile Linux, you need to install the cross-compiling
toolchain. We will use the cross-compiling toolchain that we
previously produced, so we just need to make it available in the PATH:

\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=/usr/local/xtools/arm-unknown-linux-uclibcgnueabi/bin:$PATH
\end{verbatim}

Also, don't forget to either:

\begin{itemize}
\item Define the value of the \code{ARCH} and \code{CROSS_COMPILE}
  variables in your environment (using \code{export})
\item {\bf Or} specify them on the command line at every invocation of
  \code{make}, i.e: \code{make ARCH=... CROSS_COMPILE=... <target>}
\end{itemize}

\section{Linux kernel configuration}

By running \code{make help}, find the proper Makefile target to
configure the kernel for the IGEPv2 board (hint: the default
configuration is not named after the board, but after the CPU
name). Once found, use this target to configure the kernel with the
ready-made configuration.

Don't hesitate to visualize the new settings by running
\code{make xconfig} afterwards!

As an example of configuration modification, let's change the kernel
compression from Gzip to LZMA. This compression algorithm is far more
efficient than Gzip, in terms of compression ratio, at the expense of
a higher decompression time.

\section{Cross compiling}

You're now ready to cross-compile your kernel. Simply run:

\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}

and wait a while for the kernel to compile. Don't forget to use
\code{make -j<n>} if you have multiple cores on your machine!

Look at the end of the kernel build output to see which file contains
the kernel image.

However, the default image produced by the kernel build process is not
suitable to be booted from U-Boot. A post-processing operation must be
performed using the mkimage tool provided by U-Boot developers. This
tool has already been installed in your system as part of the
\code{u-boot-tools} package. To run the post-processing operation on
the kernel image, simply run:

\begin{verbatim}
make uImage
\end{verbatim}

\section{Setting up serial communication with the board}

Plug the IGEP board on your computer. Start Picocom on
\code{/dev/ttyS0}, or on \code{/dev/ttyUSB0} if you are using a serial
to USB adapter.

You should now see the U-Boot prompt:

\begin{verbatim}
U-Boot #
\end{verbatim}

Make sure that the bootargs U-Boot environment variable is not set (it
could remain from a previous training session, and this could disturb
the next lab):

\begin{verbatim}
setenv bootargs
saveenv
\end{verbatim}

\section{Load and boot the kernel using U-Boot}

We will use TFTP to load the kernel image to the IGEP board:

\begin{itemize}

\item On your workstation, make sure your \code{uImage} file is in the
  directory exposed by the TFP server.

\item On the target, load \code{uImage} from TFTP into RAM at address
  0x80000000:\\
  \code{tftp 0x80000000 uImage}

\item Boot the kernel:\\
  \code{bootm 0x80000000}

\end{itemize}

You should see Linux boot and finally hang with the following message:

\begin{verbatim}
Waiting for root device /dev/mmcblk0p2...
\end{verbatim}

This is expected: we haven't provided a working root filesystem for
our device yet.

You can automate now all this every time the board is booted or
reset. Reset the board, and specify a different \code{bootcmd}:

\begin{verbatim}
setenv bootcmd 'tftp 80000000 uImage;bootm 80000000'
saveenv
\end{verbatim}

\section{Flashing the kernel in NAND flash}

In order to let the kernel boot on the board autonomously, we can
flash it in the NAND flash available on the IGEP. The NAND flash can
be manipulated in U-Boot using the \code{nand} command, which
features several subcommands. Run \code{help nand} to see the
available subcommands and their options.

After storing the X-loader, U-boot and its environment variables, we
will keep a special area in NAND flash for the Linux kernel image.
This 4th partition will be 4 MiB big, from NAND address
0x280000 to 0x680000.

So, let's start by erasing the corresponding 4 MiB of NAND flash:

\begin{verbatim}
nand erase 0x280000 0x400000
         (NAND addr) (size)
\end{verbatim}

Then, copy the kernel from TFTP into memory, using the same address as
before.

Then, flash the kernel image:

\begin{verbatim}
nand write 0x80000000 0x280000 0x400000
           (RAM addr)   (NAND addr) (size)
\end{verbatim}

Power your board off and on, to clear RAM contents. We should now be able to load
the kernel image from NAND and boot it using:

\begin{verbatim}
nand read 0x80000000  0x280000    0x400000
          (RAM addr)   (NAND addr) (size)
bootm 0x80000000
\end{verbatim}

\code{nand read} copies the kernel to RAM and then, \code{bootm}
executes it.

Write an U-Boot script that automates the kernel download and flashing
procedure. Finally, adjust the \code{bootcmd} so that the IGEP board
boots using the kernel in Flash.

Now, power off the board and power it on again to check that it boots
fine from NAND flash. Check that this is really your own version of
the kernel that's running.
