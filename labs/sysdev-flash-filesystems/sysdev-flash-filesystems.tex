\subchapter{Filesystems - Flash file systems}{Objective: Understand flash file systems usage and their integration on the target}

After this lab, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare filesystem images and flash them.
\item Define partitions in embedded flash storage.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

Stay in \code{$HOME/felabs/sysdev/fs}. Install the
\code{mtd-utils} package, which will be useful to create JFFS2
filesystem images.

\section{Goals}

Instead of using an external MMC card as in the previous lab, we will
make our system use its internal flash storage.

The root filesystem will still be in a read-only filesystem, put on an
MTD partition.  Read/write data will be stored in a JFFS2 filesystem
in another MTD partition. The layout of the internal NAND flash will
be:

\section{Enabling NAND flash and filesystems}

Recompile your kernel with support for JFFS2 and for support for MTD
partitions specified in the kernel command line
(\code{CONFIG_MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS}).

Also enable support for the flash chips on the board
(\code{CONFIG_MTD_NAND_OMAP2}).

Update your kernel image on flash.

\section{Filesystem image preparation}

Find the erase block size of the NAND flash device in your board.

Prepare a JFFS2 filesystem image from the \code{/www/uploads/files}
directory from the previous lab.

Modify the \code{/etc/init.d/rcS} file to mount a JFFS2 filesystem on
the sixth flash partition, instead of an ext3 filesystem on the third
MMC disk partition.

Create a JFFS2 image for your root filesystem. with the same options
as the data filesystem.

\section{MTD partitioning and flashing}

Memory layout and partitioning can be defined inside kernel sources,
naturally in the \code{arch/<arch>/<march>/board-<name>.c} since it is
board dependent. Nevertheless, during device development, it can be
useful to define partitions at boot time, on the kernel command line.

Enter the U-Boot shell and erase NAND flash, from offset 0x002e0000,
up to the end of the NAND flash storage. You'll have to compute the
remaining size of the flash, from 0x2e0000 to the end. Remember that
you can look at U-Boot booting messages to find what is the size of
the NAND flash.

Using the \code{tftp} command, download and flash the kernel image at
the correct location.

Using the \code{tftp} command, download and flash the JFFS2-ro image
the correct location.

Using the \code{tftp} command, download and flash the JFFS2 image at
the correction location.

Don't forget that you can write U-Boot scripts to automate those
procedures. This is very handy to avoid mistakes when typing commands!

Look at the way MTD partitions are defined in the kernel sources
(\code{arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-igep0020.c})

Set the \code{bootargs} variable so that:

\begin{itemize}
\item you define the 6 MTD partitions, as detailed previously
\item the root filesystem is mounted from the 5\textsuperscript{th}
  partition, and is mounted read-only (kernel parameter \code{ro})
\end{itemize}

Boot the target, check that MTD partitions are well configured, and
that your system still works as expected. Your root filesystem should
be mounted read-only, while the data filesystem should be mounted
read-write, allowing you to upload data using the web server.
