\subchapter{Develop a JNI library}{Learn how JNI works and how to integrate it
in Android}

After this lab, you will be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop bindings from Java to C
  \item Integrate these bindings into the build system
  \item Modify the Android framework
  \item Use JNI bindings
\end{itemize}

\section{Write the bindings}

The code should be pretty close to the one you wrote in the native
application lab, so you will find a skeleton of the folder to
integrate into your product definition in the
\code{$HOME/felabs/android/jni} directory. Copy the \code{frameworks}
folder you will find there into your device folder.

You will mostly have to modify function prototypes from your previous
application to make it work with JNI.

As a reminder, JNI requires the function prototype to be like:
\code{JNIEXPORT <jni type> JNICALL Java_<package_class>_<function_name>(JNIEnv *env, jobject this)}.
Beware that the function name can't have any underscore in its name
for JNI to function properly.

Aside from the \code{jni} folder, there is also a \code{java} folder that
contains a Java Interface, \code{MissileBackendImpl}. In the same folder,
write the \code{USBBackend} class implementing this interface that uses your
bindings. You have an example of such a class in the \code{DummyBackend.java}
file.

\section{Integrate it in the build system}

Now you can integrate it into the build system, so that it generates a .jar
library that is in our product, with the proper dependencies expressed.

You can find documentation about how to integrate device-specific parts of the
framework in the \code{device/sample/frameworks} folder.

\section{Testing the bindings}

We should now have a system with the files
\code{/system/framework/com.fe.android.backend.jar}, containing the Java
classes, \code{/system/lib/liblauncher_jni.so}, containing the JNI bindings and
\code{/system/lib/libusb.so}.

Test what you did using the Main class present in the Java source code
by directly invoking Dalvik through the \code{app_process}
command. You will have to provide both the classpath and the class
name to make it work and should look like
\code{CLASSPATH=path/to/java.jar app_process /system/bin com.fe.android.Main}

Once you have a solution that works, you can ask your instructor to 
give you a URL where Free Electrons' solution is available, and compare
it with what you implemented.

\section{Going further}

You will find that the binary we developed in the previous lab and
the bindings share a lot of common code. This is not very convenient
to solve bugs impacting this area of the code, since we have to make
the fix at two different places.

If you have some time left at the end of this lab, use it to make this
common code part of a shared library used by both the bindings and the
binary.
