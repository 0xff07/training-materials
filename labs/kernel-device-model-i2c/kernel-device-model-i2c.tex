\subchapter{Device Model - I2C device}{Objective: declare an I2C device
  and basic driver hooks called when this device is detected}

Throughout the upcoming labs, we will implement a driver for an I2C
device, which offers the functionality of an I2C nunchucks.

After this lab, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add an I2C device to a device tree
\item Implement basic \code{probe()} and \code{remove()} driver
functions and make sure that they are called when such a device is added or removed.
\end{itemize}
